# Conditional GAN for Fashion-MNIST Image Synthesis

![Generated Fashion Images](sample_generated_images.png)

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for image synthesis using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The model generates new fashion item images based on input conditions such as class labels.
